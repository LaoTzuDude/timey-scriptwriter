# timey-scriptwriter

The goal of this project is to have an online application that gives you an instant time estimate and word count when you are typing text.
It's ideal for very time-sensitive scripts, i.e. voice-overs for video commercials.
It would be nice to eventually have a variable reading speed slider, a timer for actual testing and maybe even some fun text-to-speech conversation option.
